              My name is Rhoda, and I am a Full Stack Developer from Toronto,
              Canada.

          </b>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I come from a professional background that includes work in
          Social Services, Education, and Customer Service. After many years
          working between these fields, I felt a push for a new challenge, and
          thankfully found it in an area that is growing, can keep me on my toes
          through constant development, and provokes curiosity and creativity.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Being that I am from a largely people-based background, I feel I have
          a lot to offer. As a Junior Dev, I think to how I can write more
          efficient code that peers can build upon and manipulate. I think to
          learning what makes more scalable databases, and apps run as quickly
          and efficiently as possible over servers. That is to say I am always
          thinking about how my work can improve the experiences of others.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          To end things off on a less formal note, in my spare time I enjoy
          sewing, a good deadlift, and cat videos ðŸ˜Š
